👨‍💻 About Me
Hi! I'm Chitrachedu Shareef Vali, a passionate and detail-oriented VLSI Design Engineer with hands-on experience in digital design, RTL coding, and simulation using Verilog/SystemVerilog. I hold an M.Tech in VLSI Design from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Bengaluru, and a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from JNTU Anantapur.

I'm particularly interested in developing power-efficient semiconductor systems, and I’ve worked extensively with tools like ModelSim, Vivado, and Cadence Xcelium for both design and verification. I’m always looking to contribute to innovative VLSI projects while sharpening my skills in STA, DFT, and physical design flows.

📂 Project Overview
This repository contains Verilog-based projects showcasing practical implementations of core VLSI design concepts:

🔶 FIR Filter (Synchronous)
Goal: Implement an efficient Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using a ripple-carry adder with Right-to-Left (R2L) addition strategy.

Features:

12-bit input/output

Parametric coefficient-based multiplication

Fully synthesizable RTL design

Tools Used: ModelSim, Vivado, Xcelium

🔷 Asynchronous FIR Filter with PTC (Experimental)
Goal: Design a power-efficient asynchronous FIR filter using Propagated Timing Constraints (PTC).

Application: Power-sensitive systems, STA compatibility.

Note: Under development.

🟢 UART Communication Module
Goal: Design a UART module for asynchronous serial data communication.

Features:

Baud rate generator

Transmit/Receive modules

Verified using a custom testbench

Output:

Test 1 Passed: Received 01010101
Test 2 Passed: Received 10101010
🚦 Intelligent Adaptive Traffic Light Controller
Goal: Real-time traffic light control using adaptive FSM with emergency vehicle detection.

Features:

Multi-sensor input for traffic load

Emergency override via sound and sensor detection

FSM with 35 states

Output:

light traffic(a1):100
medium traffic(a2):110
high traffic(a1):111
