👨‍💻 About Me
Hi! I'm Chitrachedu Shareef Vali, a passionate and detail-oriented VLSI Design Engineer with hands-on experience in digital design, RTL coding, and simulation using Verilog/SystemVerilog. I hold an M.Tech in VLSI Design from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Bengaluru, and a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from JNTU Anantapur.

I'm particularly interested in developing power-efficient semiconductor systems, and I've worked extensively with tools like ModelSim, Vivado, and Cadence for design and verification. I’m always looking to contribute to innovative VLSI projects while sharpening my skills in STA, DFT, and physical design flows.

📂 Project Overview
This repository contains Verilog-based projects that showcase practical implementations of VLSI design concepts. Below are the included modules:

🔶 FIR Filter (Synchronous)
Design Goal: To implement an efficient Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using a custom ripple-carry adder and Right-to-Left addition strategy.

Features:

12-bit input/output

Parameterized filter coefficients

Fully clocked and synthesis-friendly RTL design

Tools Used: ModelSim, Vivado

🔷 Asynchronous FIR Filter with PTC (Experimental)
Design Goal: Create a low-power asynchronous FIR filter architecture using Propagated Timing Constraints (PTC).

Application: Useful for power-sensitive VLSI chips and STA compatibility.

Note: This part is under development; please refer to the latest commit messages for updates.

🟢 UART Communication Module
Design Goal: UART module for asynchronous serial communication in FPGA or ASIC-based systems.

Features:

Baud rate control

Transmit/Receive logic

Custom testbench verification

🚦 Intelligent Adaptive Traffic Light Controller
Design Goal: Real-time traffic control using sensor-based adaptive FSM logic.

Features:

Supports emergency vehicle detection

Dynamic timing based on traffic load

Realistic simulation using ModelSim

Inputs: Multiple road sensors + emergency override

Outputs: Signal lights (Red/Yellow/Green) and camera trigger
